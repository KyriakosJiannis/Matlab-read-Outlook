# Matlab function which reads Outlook emails
Author : Kyriakos Ioannis

Matlab function which imports the 'readed' or 'unreaded' outlook emails from inbox or or its subfolders. Extracts their subjects, bodies and can save their attachements.

 I have not tested in other outlook version apart from 2007.
